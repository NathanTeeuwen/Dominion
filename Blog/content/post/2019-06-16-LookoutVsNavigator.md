In a real life game a couple weeks ago, lookout is pitted against Navigator.

The kingdom cards available were:

Coin of the Realm
Lookout
Navigator
Chariot Race
Legionary

I did not not trash my estates or get a lookout.  Openned with Navigator and went straight for a legionary.   One coin of the realm in case there was a collision.

Would it be better to buy a double lookout, trash thin as possible, purchase chariot races - and get extra points playing chariot race, while attacking the opponent
with repeated legionary attacks?
